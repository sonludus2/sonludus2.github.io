<h1>EVAN CASE</h1>
<h2>Junior in Greenville, SC</h2>
<p>I am a Junior at Bob Jones Academy.</p>
<p>I am the captain of the Bob Jones Academy Debate team and a member of the South Carolina World School Debate team. 
  I'm also a designer on BJA's yearbook, the Academian, and will be the editor next year. 
During summer and winter breaks, I work at Greenville County Information Systems as a PC repair tech.
</p>
<p>I enjoy playing games with people, trail running, reading, and singing in my spare time.
